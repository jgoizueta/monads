# Monadic code

Monads apply function composability to wrapped (encapsulated) data; they represents computation as a nested call structure (all happens inside the lambda args); (then the do notation --syntax sugar-- allows expressing that nested calls structure linearly); it can be interpreted as either a computation-description (so that it can be at some time executed including its side-effects) or as a function calls that carry world-state in the parameter.

## In Haskell

Monad is a type class (an ADT) `M a` whose instances wrap some tipe `a` (maybe the unit type ()) and with a bind operation:

    f >>= g

of type: (note that b is usually a)

    M a -> (a -> M b)

which allows composing monads (it gives `g` access to the wrapped value)

A convenient `>>` operator is defined for when the value wrapped in a monad is not needed by the composed function `g`:

    f >> g = f >>= \_ -> g

A Monad must also define a `return` (unit) function to wrap a value into a monad (needed by `g` functions to return a value)

    return : a -> M a

The rules that a Monad type must obey:

return (unit) acts as a neutral value for >>=

    [A1] : (return x) >>= f  =   f x
    [A2] : m >>= return      =   m

Associativity: (if g doesn't have a free x variable)

    [B]  : (m >>= f) >>= g   =   m >>= (\x -> (f x >>= g))

Haskell function application syntax: `f x y  is (f x) y`;
so `f (g x)`` must be parenthesed

The fact that

    f >>= g >>= h  is f >>= (g >>= h)

allows writing procedural code in the natural order and without parentheses:

    step1 >> step2 >> ....

or:

    step1 >>= \v1 -> step2(v1) >>= \v2 -> step3(v1,v2)

Note that this is: (A)

    step1 >>= (\v1 -> step2(v1) >>= (\v2 -> step3(v1,v2)))

so inner functions have access to all upper variables v1, ...

if one does this instead: (B)

    (step1 >>= \v1 -> step2(v1)) >>= \v2 -> step3(v2)

then inner (right) functions have access only to one variable v

In other languages (e.g. Ruby, JavaScript) (B) is more convenient to write, specially if using object oriented notation (i.e. v.f instead of f v) since these languages need delimiters (even Python or CoffeeScript have this limitation; they use indentation as delimiters); the form (A) requires nesting of function definitions ("piramids of doom")

Haskell do notation (syntax sugar) allows writing this:

    step1 >> step2 >>= \c2 -> step3 >>= \c3 -> step4

as:

    do
      step1;
      c2 <- step2;
      c3 <- step3;
      step4;

By rule [B] above, if inner functions don't use outer variables (e.g. step3 does not use v1) then (A) and (B) forms will have the same effect (except that form A can be more economical of function evaluations/calls) and this allows, in languages such as Ruby, to convert function nesting to chaining:

### Example in Ruby notation

    # (A) => nesting
    step1.bind ->(v1) {
      step2(v1).bind ->(v2) {
        step3(v1,v2)
      }
    }

    # (B) => chaining
    step1.bind ->(v1) {
      step2(v1)
    }.bind ->(v2) {
        step3(v2)
    }

But when outer variables are used in inner levels this is not possible;
e.g. using the Array monad to compute a cartesian product, in Haskell:

    Haskell: xs >>= \x -> ys >>= \y -> return (x, y)

or in do notation: `do x <- xs y <- ys; return (x, y)`

With:

    instance Monad [] where
    m >>= f = concat(map f m)
    return x = [x]

In Ruby this would be: `xs.bind { |x| ys.bind { |y| [[x,y]] } }`
With: `class Array; def bind(&f) map(&f).inject(&:+) end; end`

### ES6 Examples

Using JavaScript promises the above example would be:
(we assume step1 is a Promise and step2, step3 regular functions)

```javascript
// (A) => nesting
step1.then(v1 => step2(v1).then(v2 => step3(v1,v2)))

// (B) => chaining
step1.then(step2).then(step3)
```

## Nomenclature

* The >> operator is usually called "then" (or flush)
* The >>= binding combinator (composition)
  has sometimes been called in other languages "pass", "and then"
* The unit or return function may be called wrap, new (because it is a
  constructor)

Monads allow to build computations by combining simpler computation steps.

A computation can be so defined by a functional expression
(typically, in Haskell using the (A) form, the computation is defined by the tree of function parameters which is composed of nested functions)
and in the case of Haskell IO this allows to define side effects as an expression that can be executed (both returning values and performing
actions) with a variety of strategies by the compiler/VM.

## Monad examples:

IO monad is relevant in Haskell (a pure, lazy functional language) but not in imperative languages such as Ruby

The same applies to monads for error/exception management, IORefs, etc.

But other monads can be useful in other languages.

* Maybe or Optional
* Array or Many or Multiple

## JavaScript / CoffeeScript / Node

Monads can be used to refactor the typical deeply nested code in NodeJS
(asynchronous code) into serialialized chained form. For example:

* ContT in monadic: https://www.npmjs.org/package/monadic
* https://blog.jcoglan.com/2011/03/11/promises-are-the-monad-of-asynchronous-programming/

ES6 Promises can be considered a form of monads that handle asynchronicity using the concept of *futures*. The `then` method of Promises is the equivalent of the bind operation.

# Order and Nesting

There's to issues with procedural computations represented with functional languages that Monads solve:
* The order of execution of computation steps vs their code representation
* The nesting of computation steps (pyramids of doom)

## Order of execution

Let's assume we have some computation steps `f1`, `f2`, `f3`, with all state being passed trhough arguments/return values between them.

The order of execution `f1`, `f2`, `f3` is reverse in the most common functional notation (e.g. in JavaScript): `f3(f2(f1(x)))`.

In Haskell, we have  `f1 f2 f3 x` meaning `((f1 f2) f3) x`.
Then, if `f2`, `f3` take "value" (state) arguments we'd write `f3 (f2 (f1 x))` for our computation, but if `f2`, `f3` take function arguments (and compose them) we can write just `f1 f2 f3 x`.

Since this is the approach of monads (`>>=` takes a right function argument and composes it ), we can express sequential computation as `f1 >>= f2 >>= f3`.

What about other languages, e.g. Javascript?
We'll try to write functional code, avoiding local variables, otherwise we'd write something like so:

```javascript
let x1 = f1(x)
let x2 = f2(x1)
let x3 = f3(x2)
```

If we have regular functions to represent the steps:

```javascript
const f1 = x => x+1
const f2 = x => x*2
const f3 = x => x-1
const Id = x => Promise.resolve(x)
```

We intend to compute `f3(f2(f1(x)))` (i.e. `(x+1)*2-1`) but avoiding the reverse order appearance of the steps.

We can simply use Promises, a kind of monads to rewrite the computation:
```javascript
Id(x).then(f1).then(f2).then(f3)
```

We could also avoid Promises and rewrite the computation steps in a way that allows the desired ordered composability:

```javascript
const f1 = g => (x => g(x+1))
const f2 = g => (x => g(x*2))
const f3 = g => (x => g(x-1))
const Id = x => x
```

Now our computation becomes:

```javascript
f1(f2(f3(Id)))(x)
```

## Nesting

But unlike what happens in Haskell, this approach here doen't solve the other problem,
that of function nesting because of the delimiters problem discussed above.
The nesting problem arises when all the necessary state is not provided in a single argument/return value. The Promises and the composable functions approach described allow for nesting as well as chaining, but nesting can be inconvenient due to the syntax.

For example if we need multiple arguments to compose a result, which come from different previous steps:

```javascript
const f1 = v => v*2
const f2 = v => v*3
const f3 = (x,y) => [x,y]
const Id = v => v
```

The desired computation, in procedural form, is:
```javascript
v => {
  let x = f1(v);
  let y = f2(x);
  return f3(x,y);
}
```
Which can be written with Promises (in nested form):

```javascript
v => Id(v).then(f1).then(
  x => Id(f2(x)).then(y => f3(x,y))
);
```

We can avoid promises by rewriting the steps:

```javascript
const f1 = g => (v => g(v*2))
const f2 = g => (v => g(v*3))
const f3 = (x, y) => [x,y]
const Id = v => v
```

Then the computation become (again, nested):
```javascript
v => f1(x => f2(y => f3(x,y))(x))(v)
```

Note that nesting is needed because each step requires results from previous steps;
if multiple results are needed for a step but there's no depency between those results, nesting can be avoided:

```javascript
// f2 requires results from f1a and f2b, but f1a and f1b are independent
const f2 = (x, y) => [x, y]
const f1a = x => 2*x
const f1b = y => 3*y
const Id = v => Promise.resolve(v)
```

The desired computation is `f2(f1a(x), f2b(y))` and can be resolved with promises as:
```javascript
(x,y) => {
  Promise.all([Id(x).then(f1a), Id(y).then(f1b)]).then([x,y] => f2(x,y))
}
```
